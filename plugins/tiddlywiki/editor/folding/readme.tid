! Code Folding

Collapse and expand sections based on headings.

!! Features

* ''Heading-based folding'': Fold sections defined by `!` headings
* ''Hierarchy aware'': Sections include all content until next same-level or higher heading
* ''Visual indicator'': Folded sections show "… (folded)" placeholder
* ''Click to unfold'': Click the folded area to expand

!! Keyboard Shortcuts

|!Key |!Action |
|Ctrl+Shift+[ |Fold current section |
|Ctrl+Shift+] |Unfold current section |

!! How Sections Work

Sections are determined by TiddlyWiki headings:

```
! Heading 1
Content here...

!! Heading 2
This is inside Heading 1's section

! Another Heading 1
This starts a new top-level section
```

Folding `! Heading 1` will hide everything until `! Another Heading 1`.

!! Configuration

|!Tiddler |!Values |!Default |
|`$:/config/Editor/EnableFolding` |`yes` / `no` |`yes` |

!! Widget Attribute

```
<$edit-text enableFolding="yes"/>
```

!! Notes

* Fold state is not persisted between sessions
* Cursor position is preserved when folding/unfolding
* Folded content is still in the document, just visually hidden
